Todo:
    - calculation of offset (beq/bne) ?

Done:
    - calculation of offset (beq/bne): 
        current PC address (address of beq/bne)
        +   4
        +   sign_extended offset << 2

        (offset is the address of target instruction)

Todo: 
    - check if parsing different types of argument works. Possible to write junit tests for this part.
    - rework MAIN, because argument types loading has changed.

Done:
    - main is now correctly displaying arg types
    - arguments and reference ("#2") are now stored


Notes:
    - there is a question: how to represent constant values in fields ? Answer: Just represent constant values as strings and everything that isn't a constant begins with "#"
